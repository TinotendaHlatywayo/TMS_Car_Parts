## 0.4 Schema baseline
- **IDs**: ULID for domain entities; foreign keys match types.
- **Timestamps**: UTC in DB; display in branch/user timezone.
- **Archive/soft-delete**: softDeletes on platforms/branches/branch_users; audit_logs append-only (no soft delete).
- **FKs/uniques**: enforced at DB level with appropriate cascade/restrict.
- **Transactions/idempotency**: required for multi-step and retried operations.
- **Document numbering**: per (branch_id, document_type) with atomic allocation.

## 0.5 Auth and tenant
- **Auth**: Laravel Breeze API + Sanctum for SPA/auth tokens
- **Branch resolution**: Server-side from authenticated membership via ResolveBranchContext middleware; client-supplied branch_id never used for authorization
- **Authorization**: Default-deny via BranchOwnedPolicy
- **Sessions**: HttpOnly cookies, SameSite=lax, secure configurable
- **Rate limiting**: Use Laravel default throttling (to be configured per routes)

## 0.6 UI system
- **UI framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui-style components (reusable, accessible)
- **State components**: Loading (skeleton + spinner), empty, error, success, permission denied
- **Layouts**: Public, authenticated app, auth shells with responsive design
- **i18n**: Simple translation system, extensible for more locales
- **Theme**: Light/dark with CSS variables
- **A11y**: Focus-visible, ARIA labels, skip links, semantic HTML

## 0.7 Routing and skeleton
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with public/auth/app/platform routes
- **Auth flow**: Login page wired to Breeze API (Sanctum) endpoints
- **Tenant**: Branch workspace and platform console separated
- **Data**: TanStack Query for API calls

## 1.1 Users, roles and permissions
- **Roles**: Fixed code-defined branch role catalogue (`admin`, `manager`, `storekeeper`, `cashier`, `accountant`, `viewer`). Custom role CRUD is deferred; adding a role is a reviewed code change.
- **Permissions**: Code-defined `branch.*` and `platform.*` catalogues in `App\Support\Permissions`. Branch membership stores optional explicit extra branch grants; platform permissions are ignored in branch context.
- **Platform separation**: `users.is_platform_admin` is a platform-level flag for Phase 1.1. It does not grant branch access. Granular platform roles are deferred to Phase 3.
- **Authorization**: Default-deny middleware (`branch.permission`, `platform.permission`) plus server-side branch resolution. Route branch wins over `X-Branch-Id`; both are checked against membership.
- **Revocation**: Permissions are recomputed from the database on every request. Deactivating/removing a user's last active branch membership deletes API tokens and database sessions immediately.
- **User provisioning**: Public registration is disabled. Branch administrators create/attach users by email from the branch workspace.
- **Last admin**: A branch cannot demote, deactivate or remove its last active administrator.
- **Identity**: A user can belong to multiple branches; employee HR profiles remain deferred.

## 1.2 Catalogue and stock foundation
- **Branch ownership**: Products, categories and units are branch-owned. Shared cross-branch catalogue items are deferred; the same SKU/barcode may exist independently in different branches.
- **Identifiers**: SKU is required, normalized to uppercase and unique per branch. Barcode is optional, unique per branch when present, and limited to one barcode per product in this stage. Multiple/pack barcodes are deferred.
- **Money**: Prices are stored as integer minor units with the branch currency's ISO 4217 exponent. The API accepts a major-unit decimal string and returns both minor units and a formatted string.
- **Archive semantics**: Products, categories and units use `is_active=false` for archive. No hard-delete endpoint is exposed. Archived categories/units cannot be selected for new products; existing references are retained.
- **Categories**: Category slugs are unique per branch and stable on rename unless an explicit slug is supplied. Parent-child cycles and cross-branch parents are rejected.
- **Units and conversion**: Each product has one base unit. Alternate units must be configured explicitly with a conversion factor through the base unit; there are no implicit global conversion tables. Unknown, unconfigured or inactive units are rejected. Conversion factors use six decimals and conversion results round half-up to six decimals.
- **Base unit changes**: A base unit cannot change while alternate units or non-zero stock exist.
- **Stock foundation**: `stock_levels` provides branch/product balances defaulting to zero. Stage 1.2 does not post stock movements; Stage 1.3 owns the canonical movement ledger and posting rules.
- **Permissions**: Catalogue APIs reuse `branch.inventory.view` and `branch.inventory.manage` rather than adding overlapping catalogue permissions.
- **Frontend**: `/app/products` provides product search/filter/pagination, product and category/unit management, alternate units and an explicit conversion tool.

## 1.3 Canonical stock ledger
- **Canonical ledger**: `stock_movements` is the only durable stock history. `stock_levels.quantity_on_hand` is a transaction-safe projection updated in the same transaction.
- **Movement types**: `opening`, `sale`, `correction`, `reversal`.
- **Units**: every movement stores the selected unit, converted base quantity, original unit quantity and conversion factor through the product base unit.
- **Idempotency**: `idempotency_key` is unique per branch. Replaying the same key with the same payload returns the original movement; a different payload returns `409`.
- **Duplicate posting guards**: one opening movement per product; one reversal per original movement; reversal movements cannot be reversed.
- **Negative stock**: posting is rejected when the resulting balance is below zero. No overselling is permitted.
- **Concurrency**: balance updates use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the stock level row and a three-attempt DB transaction. Concurrent sale attempts are tested on MariaDB.
- **Reversal**: reversals post an equal and opposite movement and restore the balance if sufficient stock exists.
- **Audit**: every movement records branch, product, quantity, unit, conversion, source, reason, actor and timestamp.

## 1.4 Customer records
- **Branch ownership**: customers are branch-owned in Stage 1.4. Cross-branch shared customer identity is deferred.
- **No silent merge**: creating a customer with a similar name, phone or email creates a new record and returns duplicate warnings/candidates.
- **Duplicate detection**: case-insensitive name/email and normalized phone comparison within the branch; warnings do not block creation.
- **Archive**: customers are archived with `is_active=false`; no hard delete endpoint.
- **Privacy**: customer data is branch-scoped and requires `branch.customers.view` or `branch.customers.manage`.

## 1.5 POS cart and price calculation
- **Order**: base unit price -> quantity -> discount -> floor price -> tax -> approval.
- **Price snapshots**: cart pricing returns immutable line and cart totals with unit price, quantity, discount, floor, tax and totals.
- **Discount threshold**: `POS_MAX_DISCOUNT_PERCENT_WITHOUT_APPROVAL` defaults to 10 and is read from `config/pricing.php`; it is not hard-coded.
- **Approval**: discounts above the threshold or prices below floor require approval and are audited with actor and reason.
- **Tax**: tax is calculated on the net line total after discount/floor enforcement.

## 1.6 Checkout, payments and receipt
- **Transaction**: checkout posts sale, items, payments, stock movements and receipt in one DB transaction.
- **Idempotency**: branch-scoped `Idempotency-Key` replays the original sale or rejects a changed payload.
- **States**: sale status (`posted`) and payment status (`unpaid`, `partial`, `paid`) are stored separately.
- **Payments**: split payments are supported in branch currency; amounts must equal the sale total.
- **Receipts**: each sale has one unique receipt number allocated under lock.
- **Stock**: tracked products post a sale movement; insufficient stock rolls back the entire checkout.
